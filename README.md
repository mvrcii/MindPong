# MindPong: Game-Based Trial Generation for BCIs
## Motivation
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) convert the measured activities of the central nervous system into artificial output, serving as a bridge between the environment and the brain. These interfaces are utilized in scenarios like steering a wheelchair for fully paralyzed individuals purely through brain impulses. The collected EEG signals are interpreted by Artificial Intelligence (AI). For training this AI, **trials** are required, which are recorded using an EEG device. A trial is a stream of thought captured over a specific duration, during which the test subject emits the same thought impulse (e.g., thinking towards the right).

## Goal
The aim of our project is to capture EEG trials in a playful manner, without tiring the test subject. This is achieved through a simple game where the player character must reach a goal.
